Kaon-Gesture
============

Gesture demo collaboration with Helios






You can download this project and put it in the top level of your UFD key, replacing the current /Gesture folder.
You can then plug the key into a port on your vOSK and it should boot with a product model!

If you want to run this on a desktop, you can do that by downloading a Meson distribution from portals.v-central.com, un:demo pw:demo, and running index.meson
